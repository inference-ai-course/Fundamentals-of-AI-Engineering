    "Conda environments isolate your projects from each other. Each environment has its own Python version and packages, preventing version conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Commands:**\n",
    "- `conda env list`: See all environments\n",
    "- `conda create -n NAME python=X.X`: Create new environment\n",
    "- `conda activate NAME`: Switch to environment\n",
    "- `conda deactivate`: Return to base environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Multiple Environments:**\n",
    "- Project A needs Python 3.8, Project B needs 3.11\n",
    "- Different package versions for different projects\n",
    "- Test new packages without breaking existing projects\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Installing packages correctly is crucial for reproducible AI/ML work. Conda manages dependencies automatically, preventing version conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation Strategies:**\n",
    "- Use `conda install` for scientific packages (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)\n",
    "- Use `conda-forge` channel for latest versions and more packages\n",
    "- Use `pip install` only for packages not available in conda\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Packages:**\n",
    "- **NumPy**: Numerical computing, array operations\n",
    "- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization\n",
    "- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms\n",

    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting:**\n",
    "- If a package shows \"Not installed\", activate the correct environment\n",
    "- Check spelling (it's `sklearn` not `scikit-learn` for import)\n",
    "- Some packages have different import names than install names\n",

    "\n",
    "Exporting environments ensures reproducibility. Share your `environment.yml` file so others can recreate your exact setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Export Strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Full Export** (`conda env export`):\n",

    "   - Platform-specific (may not work on different OS)\n",
    "   - Exact reproduction of your environment\n",

    "   - Only packages you explicitly installed\n",
    "   - Cross-platform compatible\n",
    "   - Conda resolves dependencies on target system\n",
    "\n",
