# Level 0 Self-Study Guide

**Target Audience:** Complete beginners to AI engineering with little to no programming experience  
**Duration:** 8 weeks (flexible pacing)  
**Time Commitment:** 8-12 hours per week

---

## How to Use This Guide

This guide provides **step-by-step navigation** through the Level 0 curriculum. It tells you:
- **What to read** each week (chapter sections)
- **Where to practice** (specific Jupyter notebooks and labs)
- **How to verify** you're ready to move forward
- **What to build** as weekly proof of learning

**All coding exercises are in the chapter materials** — this guide simply shows you the path through them.

---

## Your Weekly Study Loop

Follow this pattern every week:

### 1️⃣ Read & Understand (30-40% of time)
- Read the assigned chapter sections
- Take notes on key concepts
- Don't worry if you don't understand everything — it will click when you practice

### 2️⃣ Practice & Code (50-60% of time)
- Open the chapter's Jupyter notebooks
- Run every code example yourself
- Complete all practice exercises in the notebooks
- Experiment by changing parameters and seeing what happens

### 3️⃣ Build & Verify (10-20% of time)
- Complete the weekly deliverable project
- Self-assess using the checkpoint questions
- Commit your work to Git
- Move to next week only when checkpoints pass

**Golden Rule:** Type all code yourself. No copy-paste. This is how you learn.

### When You Get Stuck
1. **Read error messages carefully** - They tell you what's wrong
2. **Print/log intermediate values** - See what's happening
3. **Simplify** - Comment out code until something works
4. **Search** - Google the exact error message
5. **Take a break** - Come back with fresh eyes
6. **Ask for help** - Community forums, study groups

### Progress Tracking
Keep a learning journal:
```markdown
# Week 1 - Day 3
**Time spent:** 2.5 hours
**Topics:** Git basics, branching
**Completed:**

- Resolved merge conflict
**Struggles:**
- Git merge was confusing
- Need to practice more
**Tomorrow:**
