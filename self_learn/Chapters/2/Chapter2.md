### For Quick Reference
Use the troubleshooting guide and code snippets in each section as a reference for common tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Command line familiarity (helpful but not required)
- No prior Python experience necessary for Part 1
- Basic understanding of programming concepts helpful for Parts 2-4

## Tools Required

- Python 3.10+ installed
- Conda or Miniconda installed
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
- Command line/terminal access

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment** following the guide in [Part 3: Conda Environment Management](./03_conda_environments.md)
2. **Clone or download the example code** from each section
3. **Run the examples** as you read through each section
4. **Complete the hands-on labs** to reinforce your learning

## Next Steps

Choose your starting point based on your experience level:
- **[Start with Part 1: Python Fundamentals](./01_python_fundamentals.md)** if you're new to Python
- **[Jump to Part 3: Conda Environments](./03_conda_environments.md)** if you know Python but need environment setup
