# Foundamental Course — Week 8 Tutorials

## Pre-study (Self-learn)

Foundamental Course assumes Self-learn is complete. If you need a refresher:

- [Pre-study index (Foundamental Course → Self-learn)](../PRESTUDY.md)
- [Self-learn Schedule](../../self_learn/Schedule.md)

## Overview

This week you make your capstone **demo-ready** and write a **retrospective**.

You will practice:

- demo readiness (no magic steps)
- documentation as the interface
- a short, structured retrospective
- preparing for Level 2 mindset shift

## Navigation

- [01 — Demo readiness checklist + README polishing](01_demo_readiness.md)
- [02 — Retrospective / postmortem template](02_retrospective_template.md)
- [03 — Preparing for Level 2 (what changes)](03_preparing_for_level2.md)

## Recommended order

1. Read 01 and make your demo reproducible.
2. Read 02 and write your retrospective.
3. Read 03 to understand the next-level skills.

Why this order works:

1. **Demo reproducibility first**
    - A demo is a test of your interfaces: README steps, CLI defaults, stable outputs.
    - What to verify: a “fresh clone + README steps” run works without you editing code live.

2. **Retrospective second**
    - Writing a retrospective forces you to separate symptoms (“it crashed”) from root causes (“timeouts + no retries”).
    - What to include: one failure case, the evidence (logs/artifacts), and the fix.

3. **Level 2 transition last**
    - After you have a stable Foundamental Course project, you can understand what changes in Level 2 (eval sets, observability, trust boundaries).
