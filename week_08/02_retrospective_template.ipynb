    "## What success looks like (end of Part 02)\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can write a short retrospective that separates symptoms from root causes.\n",
    "- You can link to evidence (logs/artifacts) using file paths under `output/`.\n",
    "- You produce a `output/RETROSPECTIVE.md` artifact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this notebook, you should have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `output/RETROSPECTIVE.md` created\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a blameless retrospective structure\n",
    "- Separate symptoms from root causes\n",
    "- Capture fixes and lessons learned\n",

    "### What this part covers\n",
    "This notebook guides you through writing a **blameless retrospective** — a structured reflection on what you built, what went wrong, why it went wrong, and what you'd do differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why \"blameless\"?** The goal is to learn from failures, not assign fault. Every failure is a system design gap, not a personal mistake. This mindset is standard in engineering culture (Google SRE, Stripe, etc.) and makes retrospectives more honest and useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The retrospective has 6 sections:**\n",
    "1. **What I built** — describe the system in 3–6 sentences\n",
    "2. **What went well** — with evidence (diffs, logs, metrics)\n",
    "3. **What went wrong** — top 3 issues with symptoms and evidence\n",
    "4. **Root causes** — why each issue happened (not just what happened)\n",
    "5. **Fixes implemented** — what changed in code or process\n",
    "6. **What I'd do next** — concrete Level 2 direction"

    "\n",

    "### What this cell does\n",
    "Shows the full retrospective template as a Markdown code block — the exact structure you should follow when writing `RETROSPECTIVE.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use this template:**\n",
    "- Copy each section heading and fill in your own content\n",
    "- For \"What went wrong\": be specific — include the exact error message, which command triggered it, and how often it happened\n",
    "- For \"Root causes\": ask \"why\" 5 times (the \"5 Whys\" technique). The first \"why\" is usually a symptom; the fifth is usually a design gap you can actually fix.\n",
    "- For \"Fixes implemented\": link to specific code changes — a function name, a file, a commit. Vague fixes (\"improved error handling\") are less useful than specific ones (\"added `validate_shape()` call before `json.dumps()` in `report_stage()`\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evidence matters:** Every claim in your retrospective should be backed by an artifact — a log file, a JSON output, a metric comparison. \"The pipeline was unreliable\" is weak. \"20% of runs failed with `json.JSONDecodeError` (see `output/04_llm_raw.json`).\" is strong."
