# Level 1 — Week 6 Tutorials

## Overview

This week you build the **capstone happy path** end-to-end:

- CSV profiling
- sampling/compression to fit context limits
- LLM call using your client
- stable outputs: `report.json` + `report.md`

## Navigation

- [01 — From scripts to pipelines (stages + artifacts)](01_pipeline_design.md)
- [02 — Sampling/compression strategies for tabular data](02_sampling_compression.md)
- [03 — Chunking long text + synthesizing summaries](03_chunking_synthesis.md)
- [04 — End-to-end capstone runner (one command)](04_capstone_runner.md)

## Recommended order

1. Read 01 and outline your pipeline stages.
2. Read 02/03 to handle context constraints.
3. Implement 04 to run everything with one command.
