# Level 1 — Week 3 Tutorials

## Overview

These tutorials expand Week 3 into practical LLM engineering skills:

- tokens + context windows (why long inputs fail)
- prompts as contracts
- strict JSON outputs
- validation + retry/repair patterns

## Navigation

- [01 — Tokens and context windows (practical intuition)](01_tokens_context.md)
- [02 — Prompts as API contracts (design patterns)](02_prompt_contracts.md)
- [03 — Structured outputs: JSON parsing + validation + retry/repair](03_structured_outputs_validation.md)

## Recommended order

1. Read 01 for the mental model (this prevents many “why did the model ignore me?” issues).
2. Read 02 and write prompts as specs.
3. Read 03 and implement validation + repair.

Use [practice.ipynb](practice.ipynb) for additional hands-on work.
