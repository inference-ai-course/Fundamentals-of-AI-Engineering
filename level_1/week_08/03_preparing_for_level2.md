# Week 8 — Part 03: Preparing for Level 2 (what changes)

## Overview

Level 1 is mostly:

- a single-project pipeline
- mostly offline, script-based
- focusing on reproducibility and reliability basics

Level 2 shifts toward **systems thinking**:

- retrieval (RAG)
- evaluation loops
- multi-step agent workflows
- knowledge bases

---

## Practical mindset shifts

- From “one script works” → “the system is observable and testable”.
- From “prompting” → “prompt + retrieval + evaluation”.
- From “manual checking” → “repeatable eval sets”.
