# Week 8 — Part 03: Preparing for Level 2 (what changes)

## Overview

Level 1 is mostly:

- a single-project pipeline
- mostly offline, script-based
- focusing on reproducibility and reliability basics

Level 2 shifts toward **systems thinking**:

- retrieval (RAG)
- evaluation loops
- multi-step agent workflows
- knowledge bases

---

## Pre-study (Level 0)

Level 1 assumes Level 0 is complete. If you need a refresher on the overall roadmap and prerequisites:

- [Pre-study index (Level 1 → Level 0)](../PRESTUDY.md)
- [Level 0 Schedule](../../level_0/Schedule.md)

Why it matters here (Week 8):

- Level 2 introduces new failure surfaces (retrieval + multi-step workflows) and requires tighter observability and evaluation.

---

## Practical mindset shifts

- From “one script works” → “the system is observable and testable”.
- From “prompting” → “prompt + retrieval + evaluation”.
- From “manual checking” → “repeatable eval sets”.
