# Week 8 — Part 01: Demo readiness checklist + README polishing

## Overview

A demo is successful when another person can reproduce it.

This means:

- a clean setup section
- one command to run
- predictable outputs
- at least one failure-case story

---

## Demo readiness checklist

- Setup steps start from scratch:
  - create env
  - install deps
  - configure secrets

- Run steps:
  - one command
  - expected outputs listed

- Outputs:
  - stable file paths
  - stable schema fields

- Failure case:
  - show what happens when an input is invalid
  - show how logs help

---

## Self-check

- Can a teammate run your demo without asking you questions?
- Can you demo without editing code live?
