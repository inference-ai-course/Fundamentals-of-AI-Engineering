# Level 1 — Week 2 Tutorials

## Overview

These tutorials expand Week 2 into a step-by-step, reproducible baseline ML workflow.

## Navigation

- [01 — The ML training loop (split → train → evaluate → save)](01_training_loop.md)
- [02 — Reproducibility package (seeds, configs, artifacts)](02_reproducibility_package.md)
- [03 — Comparing runs + writing a short report](03_compare_runs_report.md)

## Recommended order

1. Read 01 and get a baseline run working.
2. Read 02 and make your artifacts reproducible.
3. Read 03 and practice controlled comparisons.

Use [practice.ipynb](practice.ipynb) for extra hands-on work.
